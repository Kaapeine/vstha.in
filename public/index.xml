      <description>Wasteland Despite accounts of mist and haze, detours/ were made to turn inland towards the cove,/ the instruments read true, with heading east/ they cruised till they spotted the yellow coast/ And here the maps promised the cove with still/ under sand buried deep untouched till date/ was the great harbour of El Dorado/ Rumoured hidden within inside was gold,/ enough for all with will and grit to stand/ Posideon&amp;rsquo;s wrath, and so these men followed/ their maps to now arrive at their final mark/ Their sensors indicate the spot to strike/ with spades, and now being so close, they dig/ quick and they find, to their tired heart&amp;rsquo;s joy,/ their beliefs come true, their long awaited/ treasure precious at last within their grasp!</description>
