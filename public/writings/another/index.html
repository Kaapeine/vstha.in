  <h1 id="wasteland">Wasteland</h1>
<p>Despite accounts of mist and haze, detours/
were made to turn inland towards the cove,/
the instruments read true, with heading east/
they cruised till they spotted the yellow coast/
And here the maps promised the cove with still/
under sand buried deep untouched till date/
was the great harbour of El Dorado/
Rumoured hidden within inside was gold,/
enough for all with will and grit to stand/
Posideon&rsquo;s wrath, and so these men followed/
their maps to now arrive at their final mark/
Their sensors indicate the spot to strike/
with spades, and now being so close, they dig/
quick and they find, to their tired heart&rsquo;s joy,/
their beliefs come true, their long awaited/
treasure precious at last within their grasp!/
They grab their prize and look towards their boats,/
and see raised above the water jagged/
rocks, hidden till now from view by high tide/
A gust of wind blows hard starboard, a slip/
of rope leaves the anchor knot clean undone,/
the ship sent hurtling quick into the crags/
The rocks sculpted sharp by the water&rsquo;s flow/
break through the hull with ease, a thunder crash/
brings the sailors to their knees, in prayer/
to their Lord, having not yet realised that/
so far from home, in distant parts still damned,/
in foreign lands they&rsquo;re ruled by foreign Gods</p>
