# Cicada Sound

The thundering monsoon falls up against\
pattering roof, steel grey exploding sound,\
and I lie on the floor,\
my heart pounding with release come so sweet

Rain cools the earth, the sound brings down the sky,\
furious like cicada cries transcends,\
and I walk through the glade,\
my heart entranced with perfect divine sound
