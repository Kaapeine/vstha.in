# Summer's End

quiet orange glow belies turbid hopes\
of summers last till half past noon\
fading most days\
it never ends, ruins blue dreams\
of sphinxes drugged entwined in daze,\
your swirling face\
comes up to me, your arms stretched thin\
before i reach you turn to leave\
meet me halfway\
all roads are closed forgo your home\
of summers past where lovers meet\
leave me alone
