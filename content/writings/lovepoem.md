# Love Poem

There always seems to be distance between\
my self inside and what I show to all,\
past so hard I've tried to shorten the line,\
seldom ends well and a death by thousand\
cuts awaits, so I stand alone waiting,\
for you who can stride past the line despite\
the rules, going your way till hell or worse,\
see past my self, recognise I'm human,\
without a calculus accept me whole.\
To you i profess heart's undying love,\
my love that within these words lies yet still
