# Wasteland

The world ends ruled by rough hard men riding\
on motorcycles across deserts with\
irradiated light bouncing off of chrome,\
waging war to each other with diesel and\
chains, the women bound by hand and fist\
to do the bidding of their leather clad\
masters, and men muscular at their call\
to hurt or kill for them in brutal ways,\
every clan vies to outdo each other\
in cruelty, This is the order that man\
arrived at once the bomb was dropped and life\
made scarce, the world now dealt with sex and oil,\
with trading of women's bodies made flesh\
for vile men to abuse, all power rests in\
the loins of a few rough hard men, in the\
deserts, in a fight over what little\
water remains, this is how the world ends
