# Symbols

The promises of snakes lead men astray\
breaking old fences they shouldn't have dared\
To look beyond whence these old symbols came\
by ancients yore might be disbarred profane\
To question is man's right but to know might not,\
signs meaningless accumulate power\
over scales of time comprehension beyond\
To what you arrive once you deconstruct\
depths unknown to man's folly distill down\
Man's curiosity, his greatest gift,\
must be tempered with a sense of the sublime\
imagination that mankind's dreamt up
