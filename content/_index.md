Hi, I'm Vathsa. I'm a Software Engineer with experience in full stack development and robotics. I've worked on web apps, a browser game, motion planning & visual SLAM for drones. I love programming and learning about how computers work under the hood. Outside of work, I enjoy sci-fi, heavy music, history, creative coding, synths. I also make music occasionally.

Feel free to explore and you can reach me at msshrivathsa@gmail.com if you find anything to talk about.
